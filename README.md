#Choosing A Text Editor

What is a text editor?
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

We can also use The Software That Already
Comes With my Computer:
Every computer will come with its own text editor. On Mac
computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called,
“Text Edit.” On Windows computers, the text editor that comes with
your computer is called, “Notepad.”
